# User definitions conform to the following pattern:
#   User USER_NAME USER_PASSWORD USER_PERMISSIONS
# Where USER_PERMISSIONS can be zero or more of the following:
#   C - chat with other users
#   T - set the server topic
#   B - adjust BPM / BPI of server
#   K - kick other people
#   R - log in even when server is full
#   M - log in multiple times 
#   * - allow all permissions ("admin" permissions)
User administrator myadminpass *   # allow all functions
User booga anotherpass CBTKRM      # allow chat, bpm/bpi, topic changing, and kicking, a reserved slot, and multiple logins
User myuser mypass                 # allow default functions (chat, no topic)

# A `StatusUserPass` user type also exists for simple status retrieving permissions. This uses less server resources than a full `User`
# StatusUserPass username password
